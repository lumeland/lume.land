Brotli is a lossless data compression algorithm developed by Google and primarily
used by web servers and CDNs to compress the HTTP content. It's used as an
alternative to gzip on the web as it provides better overall compression.

This plugin creates a precompressed version of your files. For example, in
addition to `/index.html`, it creates a compressed version at `/index.html.br`.

## Installation

Import this plugin in your `_config.ts` file to use it:

```js
import lume from "lume/mod.ts";
import brotli from "lume/plugins/brotli.ts";

const site = lume();

site.use(brotli());

export default site;
```

By default, only some text-based formats like `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, `.svg`,
`.json`, etc are compressed. Binary files like images or videos are not
compressed because most of them have their own compression. Use the `extensions`
option to configure which extensions do you want to compress:

```js
site.use(
  brotli({
    extensions: [".html", ".css"],
  }),
);
```

## How to serve precompressed files

If you're on Deno Deploy, you can use the
[precompress](../plugins/brotli.md) middleware that will automatically
serve the `.br` version if it's available and the browser supports it.

Many other web servers have the option to serve precompressed files, for example
[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/file_server#precompressed),
or frameworks like
[Hono](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/deno#precompressed),
[Fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-static?tab=readme-ov-file#precompressed),
or [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/static?tab=readme-ov-file#options).
