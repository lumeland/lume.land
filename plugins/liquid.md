## Description

[Liquid](https://liquidjs.com/) is a simple, expressive, and safe template
engine. This plugin allows you to use it to create pages and layouts.

## Installation

Import this plugin in your `_config.ts` file to use it:

```js
import lume from "lume/mod.ts";
import liquid from "lume/plugins/liquid.ts";

const site = lume();

site.use(liquid());

export default site;
```

See
[all available options in Deno Doc](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/x/lume/plugins/liquid.ts/~/Options).
[Go to the Liquid options page](https://liquidjs.com/api/interfaces/liquid_options_.liquidoptions.html)
for more info about specific Liquid settings.

## Creating layouts

Add a file with `.liquid` extension in the `_includes` directory. Use the _front
matter_ to set data for the template.

```html
---
title: Welcome to my page
intro: This is my first post using Lume. I hope you like it!
---

<html>
  <head>
    <title>{{ title }}</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>{{ intro }}</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Creating pages

Creating pages is the same as creating layouts; just place the `.liquid` file
outside the `_includes` directory.

## `liquid` filter

The Liquid plugin also registers the `liquid` filter, to render any string value
as a Liquid template and output HTML. The filter accepts an object with data.

```html
---
data:
  username: Oscar
text: "Hello {{ username }}"
---

<!-- Render a string -->
<div>{{ text | liquid: data }}<div>
```
