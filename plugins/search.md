## Description

This plugin registers the `search` helper to search pages from other pages. It's
useful to build menus or other navigation stuff.

## Installation

This plugin is installed by default. üéâ

## Search pages

The function `search.pages()` returns an array of pages that you can filter and
sort.

### Search by tags

To search by tags, just include the tag names as the first argument, separated
by spaces. For example, to search all pages containing the tags `post` and
`html`, you would execute `search.pages("post html")`:

```vento
<ul>
  {{ for post of search.pages("post html") }}
  <li>{{ post.title }}</li>
  {{ /for }}
</ul>
```

You can use quotes to search for tags containing spaces. For example to search
by the tags `post` and `static site generator`:

```vento
<ul>
  {{ for post of search.pages("post 'static site generator'") }}
  <li>{{ post.title }}</li>
  {{ /for }}
</ul>
```

Use the exclamation mark to search pages that doesn't contain a specific tag.
For example, to search pages with the tag "post" not containing the tag "html":

```vento
<ul>
  {{ for post of search.pages("post !html") }}
  <li>{{ post.title }}</li>
  {{ /for }}
</ul>
```

### Sort the results

The second argument is the value used to sort. By default, the pages are sorted
by `date`, but you can use any field. For example, if you want to sort by title:

```vento
<ul>
  {{ for post of search.pages("post html", "title") }}
  <li>{{ post.title }}</li>
  {{ /for }}
</ul>
```

Note: You can use dot notation to sort by any subfield. For example:
`header.title`.

Sorting allows specifying multiple fields. For example let's sort by the "order"
and "title" fields:

```vento
{{ for post of search.pages("post html", "order title") }}
  ...
{{ /for }}
```

By default, sort is ascendening, but this can be changed by appending `=desc` to
the field name:

```vento
{{ for post of search.pages("post html", "order=asc title=desc") }}
  ...
{{ /for }}
```

As of Lume 2.3.0 there are two new sorting options, useful for strings with
accents or different cases: the `asc-locale` and `desc-locale`. Under the hood,
it uses the
[localeCompare](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare)
comparison method, so these options must be used only with strings.

```vento
{{ for post of search.pages("post html", "order=asc title=desc-locale") }}
  ...
{{ /for }}
```

### Limit the results

The third argument of `search.pages()` allows limiting the number of results.
You can use a positive number to return the first `n` results or a negative
number to return the last `n` results:

```vento
<!-- Get the 3 first values -->
{{ for post of search.pages("post html", "order title", 3) }}
  ...
{{ /for }}

<!-- Get the 3 last values -->
{{ for post of search.pages("post html", "order title", -3) }}
  ...
{{ /for }}
```

### Filtering by a field

You can filter pages not only by tags but also by any other field that you want.
For example, to search all pages with the value `menu` as `true`, simply include
the query `menu=true`:

```vento
{{ for option of search.pages("menu=true") }}
<a href="{{ option.url }}">
  {{ option.title }}
</a>
{{ /for }}
```

Another common example is to list all pages from a directory:

```vento
{{ for option of search.pages("url^=/blog/") }}
<a href="{{ option.url }}">
  {{ option.title }}
</a>
{{ /for }}
```

The available operators for the conditions are:

- `=` to search coincidences, for example `menu=true`. The strings `true` and
  `false` are converted to booleans automatically. `undefined` and `null` are
  also converted so you can filter pages without a value with
  `keyname=undefined`. The strings with numeric values are also converted to
  numbers.
- `^=` to search values starting with another value. For example all categories
  starting with the letter `A`: `category^=A`.
- `$=` to search values ending with another value. For example all categories
  ending with the letter `b`: `category$=b`.
- `*=` to search values containing another value. For example all titles
  containing the string `security`: `title*=security`.
- `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` to search values lower or greater than the other value.
  For example, all pages with level greater than 2: `level>2`.

You can use the dot notation and even combine queries with tags. For example,
let's say you want to select all pages with the value `taxonomy.category=sport`
and with the tag `football`:

```vento
{{ for post of search.pages("taxonomy.category=sport football") }}
<a href="{{ post.url }}">
  {{ post.title }}
</a>
{{ /for }}
```

### Negative conditions

You can prepend the `!` character to the operator to negate the condition. For
example while `menu=true` returns pages whose `menu` variable is `true`,
`menu!=true` returns pages whose `menu` variable is NOT `true`.

All operators accepts NOT operators. For example `category!^=A` (pages which
categories that does NOT start with the letter `A`), or `title!*=security`
(pages whose title does NOT contain the word "security").

Alternatively, you can prepend the `!` character at the begining of the
condition. For example `!menu=true` is equivalent to `menu!=true`, and
`!category^=A` is equivalent to `category!^=A`.

### Using `|` for OR conditions

You can assign several values for any condition using the pipe character `|`.
For example, if you want to search pages having the tag `html` OR `css`, you can
do it with `search.pages("html|css")`. You can combine AND and OR using spaces
and pipes. For example, to search all pages with the tag `post` and also one of
the tags `html` or `css`: `search.pages("post html|css")`.

OR conditions can be used with other fields. For example, to search pages with
titles containing the words "html", "css" or "javascript":
`search.pages("title*=html|css|javascript")`.

## Search one page

The function `search.page()` is very similar to `search.pages()` but only
returns the first page found. Note the `limit` argument is not available.

## Searching next and previous page

If the current page belongs to a list of pages (for example, a list of pages
under the same tag), you can get the previous and next page in this list. To do
that we have the functions `search.previousPage()` and `search.nextPage()`. The
syntax is the same as `search.pages()`, but the first argument is the URL of the
current page. Let's see an example:

```vento
<h2>More articles tagged as "html"</h2>

{{ set post = search.previousPage(url, "html") }}

{{ if post }}
  <a href="{{ post.url }}" rel="prev">‚Üê {{ post.title }}</a>
{{ /if }}

{{ set post = search.nextPage(url, "html") }}

{{ if post }}
  <a href="{{ post.url }}" rel="next">{{ post.title }} ‚Üí</a>
{{ /if }}
```

## Get all values of a key

The function `values()` returns all values found for a specific key, removing
duplicates. For example, let's say your pages have the variable `author` and you
want to list all authors:

```vento
<strong>List of authors:</strong>

<ul>
  {{ for author of search.values("author") }}
  <li>
    {{ author }}
  </li>
  {{ /for }}
</ul>
```

Use the second argument to filter the pages to get the values. For example, to
get the authors of pages in the category `sport`:
`search.values("author", "category=sport")`.

## Search data

The function `data` returns the data associated with any file or directory in
the source directory. This is useful to get the data stored in any `_data` of
any directory. For example:

```vento
{{ set companyData = search.data("about/the-company") }}
```

## Search files

The function `files()` allows to search any file that will be copied to the
`dest` folder and returns its URL. It accepts a regular expression or a string
with a glob expression. For example, to search all CSS files:

```vento
This site uses the following CSS files:

<ul>
  {{ for file of search.files("*.css") }}
  <a href="{{ file }}">
    {{ file }}
  </a>
  {{ /for }}
</ul>
```
