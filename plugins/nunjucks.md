## Description

[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) is a powerful template language
created by Mozilla and inspired by **ninja2**. This plugin allows you to use it
to create pages and layouts.

## Installation

Import this plugin in your `_config.ts` file to use it:

```js
import lume from "lume/mod.ts";
import nunjucks from "lume/plugins/nunjucks.ts";

const site = lume();

site.use(nunjucks(/* Options */));

export default site;
```

## Creating layouts

Add a file with `.njk` extension in the `_includes` directory. Use the _front
matter_ to set data to the template.

```html
--- title: Welcome to my page intro: This is my first post using Lume. I hope
you like it! ---

<html>
  <head>
    <title>{{ title }}</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>{{ intro }}</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Creating pages

Creating pages is the same as creating layouts; just place the `.njk` file
outside the `_includes` directory.

## Registered filters

### njk

The Nunjucks plugin also registers the `njk` filter, to render any string value
as a Nunjucks template and output it as HTML. The filter accepts an object with
data.

```html
---
data:
  username: Oscar
text: "Hello {{ username }}"
---

<!-- Render a string -->
<div>{{ text | njk(data) | safe }}<div>
```

### await

The `await` filter is registered to run async functions inside Nunjucks
templates. It's useful to run components:

```html
<div>{{ comp.button({ text: "Click here" }) | async | safe }}</div>
```

## Components

[Lume's components](../docs/core/components.md) are accessible through the
variable `comp`.

```html
{{ comp.button({ content: "Click here" }) | async | safe }}
```

The `async` filter is required because components are asynchronous and `safe`
prevents to escape the HTML code generated by the component.

### comp tag

The `comp` special tag allows to pass content to the components, similarly to
JSX. This is useful for composability:

```html
{% comp "button" %}Click here{% endcomp %}
```

It's possible to pass additional properties:

```html
{% comp "button" type="submit" %}Click here{% endcomp %}
```

## Configure VSCode

You can use the
[Nunjucks extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ronnidc.nunjucks)
for syntax highlight and some useful snippets.

## Async mode

Lume file loader is asynchronous, meaning that files imported by Nunjucks must
use the async API (`asyncEach` instead of `for` etc). For example, the following
code won't work:

```html
{% if includeHeader %} {% include "header.njk" %} {% endif %}
```

You have to use the async mode:

```html
{% ifAsync includeHeader %} {% include "header.njk" %} {% endif %}
```
