Documents allows to define individual files that can be edited directly in the
CMS. Unlike [collections](collections.md), documents can be edited, but not
removed or created. It's useful if you want to be able to edit configuration
files, data files or unique pages like the landing page.

To define a document in LumeCMS you need 3 things:

- The document name. For example: "Landing page".
- The storage used to read and write the content of this page.
- The fields used to modify the content.

The function `cms.document()` allows to define a document:

```ts
cms.document("landing-page", "src:index.yml", [
  "title: text",
  "subtitle: text",
  "content: markdown",
]);
```

In the example above, we have defined the `landing-page` document, that is saved
in the `index.yml` file in the `src` storage. In the CMS we can edit the title,
subtitle and content fields. See [fields documentation](../fields/index.md) for
more info about how to configure the document fields.

## Extra options

For additional options, use an object like this:

```ts
cms.document({
  name: "landing-page",
  store: "src:index.yml",
  fields: [
    "title: text",
    "subtitle: text",
    "content: markdown",
  ],
});
```

In addition to `name`, `store` and `fields`, documents have the following
options:

### description

It allows to insert a description below the document name:

```ts
cms.document({
  name: "landing-page",
  description: "Edit the content of the landing page",
  store: "src:index.yml",
  fields: [
    "title: text",
    "subtitle: text",
    "content: markdown",
  ],
});
```

### label

The visible name of this document in the menu. If it's not defined, the `name`
value is used.

```ts
cms.document({
  name: "landing-page",
  label: "This is your homepage",
  description: "Edit the content of the home page",
  store: "src:index.yml",
  fields: [
    "title: text",
    "subtitle: text",
    "content: markdown",
  ],
});
```

### previewUrl

The `previewUrl` option allows to set a preview URL of the document. It's used for
documents that don't generate a page but their changes can affect to certain
page that we want to preview.

### edit

Useful if you don't want to edit the document.

```ts
cms.document({
  name: "landing-page",
  store: "src:index.yml",
  fields: [
    "title: text",
    "subtitle: text",
    "content: markdown",
  ],
  edit: false,
});
```

### views

An array of the views that are visible by default. It's possible to use a
function to return the array dynamically.

### type

Configure the type of document. By default is `object`, which means that the root elements is an object. 

Let's see an example:

```js
cms.document({
  name: "notes",
  storage: "src:notes.json",
  type: "object", // default value, no need to specify
  fields: [
    "title: text",
    "text: textarea",
  ],
});
```

This configuration generates the following file. Note that the root element is an object:

```json
{
  "title": "Note title",
  "text": "This is the note"
}
```

The `object-list` type allows to store an array of objects:

```js
cms.document({
  name: "notes",
  storage: "src:notes.json",
  type: "object-list",
  fields: [
    "title: text",
    "text: textarea",
  ],
});
```

```json
[
  {
    "title": "First note",
    "text": "Text of the first note"
  },
  {
    "title": "Second note",
    "text": "Text of the second note"
  }
]
```
