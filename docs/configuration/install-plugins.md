Plugins add extra functionality or support for new formats. There are some basic
plugins installed by default (like support for `markdown`, `yaml` or `json`
files), but there are other plugins that you can enable. For example, to add the
`svgo` plugin (that optimizes SVG files using the SVGO library), you have to
import the plugin and enable it with `use()` in the config file:

```js
import lume from "lume/mod.ts";
import svgo from "lume/plugins/svgo.ts";

const site = lume();

site.use(svgo());

export default site;
```
