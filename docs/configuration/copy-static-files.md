Static files are files that don't have to be processed, like images, PDFs,
videos or audio. So it's better (and faster) to copy these files directly to the
`dest` directory with the `copy()` method:

```js
// Copy the "img" directory to _site/img
site.copy("img");

// Copy the file to _site/favicon.ico
site.copy("favicon.ico");
```

The path is relative to the source directory of your site (configured in `src`),
and the files and directories are copied as is, maintaining the same directory
structure. Use the second argument to change the output directory:

```js
// Copy the "img" directory to _site/images
site.copy("img", "images");

// Copy the "static-files/favicons/favicon.ico" to _site/favicon.ico
site.copy("static-files/favicons/favicon.ico", "favicon.ico");

// Copy the content of "assets" directory to the root of your site
site.copy("assets", ".");
```

## Ignored files

Note that the ignore settings explained in [Ignore files](./ignore-files.md) are
applied when copying static files, including files starting with `_` and `.`.
for example:

```js
// Ignore a subfolder
site.ignore("/files/pictures/");

// Copy the /files/ folder.
// Note that the /files/pictures/ folder is ignored,
// in addition to all files starting with . and _
site.copy("/files/");
```

If you need to copy a file starting with `.` or `_`, you have to add it
explicitly:

```js
// Copy an underscored file
site.copy("_headers");
```

## Copy by file extension

Another way to select files is by extension. Use an array with the extensions of
the files that you want to copy:

```js
// Copy all image files
site.copy([".jpg", ".gif", ".png"]);
```

This will copy all files with the extensions `.jpg`, `.gif` and `.png`, keeping
the original file structure. For example, the file `/img/pictures/image.jpg`
will be copied into `_site/img/pictures/image.jpg`.

## Customize the destination

For more fine-tuning of the file destination, you can provide a function in the
second argument that accepts the original file path and returns the destination
path:

```js
// Copy all files in the static directory but ensure they are lower case
site.copy("static", (file) => file.toLowerCase());

// Copy all images in the /img/ directory
site.copy([".jpg", ".gif", ".png"], (file) => "/img" + file);
```

> `.md`, `.vto`, etc.

## Copy remaining files

Sometimes it's not possible to know all files that must be copied ahead-of-time,
because they can be stored in any folder or can have any extension. For example,
imagine you have a website with articles, and every article is stored in a
folder that can contain static files with any extension:

```txt
|_ articles/
    |_ article-1/
    |   |_ index.md
    |   |_ picture.jpg
    |   |_ document.pdf
    |   |_ foo32.gif
    |_ article-2/
        |_ index.md
        |_ journey.mp4
        |_ download.zip
```

We cannot do `site.copy("articles")`, because the `index.md` files are inside
these folders and wouldn't be processed (they would be treated as static files).
We could select the files by extension with
`site.copy([".jpg", ".pdf", ".gif", ".mp4", ".zip"])` but every time a file with
a new extension is uploaded to our site, we would have to remember to update the
`_config` file.

For these use cases, there's the `copyRemainingFiles()` function that basically
says: when you find a file and don't know what to do with it, copy it. To setup
this behavior, just add the following line to your _config file:

```ts
site.copyRemainingFiles();
```

It's possible to include a function in the first argument to filter which files
must be copied. For example, if we only want to copy the remaining files inside
the `/articles/` folder:

```ts
site.copyRemainingFiles(
  (path: string) => path.startsWith("/articles/"),
);
```

If the filter returns a string instead of a boolean, it will be used to rename
the file. For example, let's say we want to ensure all files are in lower case:

```ts
site.copyRemainingFiles(
  (path: string) => path.startsWith("/articles/") ? path.toLowerCase() : false,
);
```
