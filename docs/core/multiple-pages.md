It's possible to generate more than one page from the same source file with
Lume. This is useful to generate pages programmatically using an external source
like a database or an API.

## Basic example

To generate pages the source file must return a
[generator function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*).
Every element yielded by the generator is a new page and must contain, at least,
the `url` property.

```js
export default function* () {
  yield {
    url: "/page-1/",
    content: "This is the first page",
  };
  yield {
    url: "/page-2/",
    content: "This is the second page",
  };
  yield {
    url: "/page-3/",
    content: "This is the third page",
  };
}
```

In the example above, this page generates three pages. It's important that the
URLs of the pages be unique.

## Multiple pages with layouts

Every page is an object with the page data. In the previous example, every page
has the `url` and `content` properties, to define the content and URL of every
page. If you want to use a layout to generate the page content, you have to
export the `layout` keyword with the layout name and the data that will be used
in the layouts:

<lume-code>

```js {title="pages.page.js"}
export default function* () {
  yield {
    url: "/page-1/",
    layout: "layouts/article.vto",
    title: "Article 1",
    body: "Welcome to the article 1",
  };
  yield {
    url: "/page-2/",
    layout: "layouts/article.vto",
    title: "Article 2",
    body: "Welcome to the article 2",
  };
  yield {
    url: "/page-3/",
    layout: "layouts/article.vto",
    title: "Article 3",
    body: "Welcome to the article 3",
  };
}
```

```vento {title=_includes/layouts/article.vto}
---
layout: layouts/base.vto
---

<article>
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  <div>
    {{ body |> md }}
  </div>
</article>
```

</lume-code>

Because the layout is the same for all pages, we can use a named export to
define it once instead of duplicating it in every yielded page:

<lume-code>

```js {title="pages.page.js"}
export const layout = "layouts/article.vto";

export default function* () {
  yield {
    url: "/page-1/",
    title: "Article 1",
    body: "Welcome to the article 1",
  };
  yield {
    url: "/page-2/",
    title: "Article 2",
    body: "Welcome to the article 2",
  };
  yield {
    url: "/page-3/",
    title: "Article 3",
    body: "Welcome to the article 3",
  };
}
```

```vento {title=_includes/layouts/article.vto}
---
layout: layouts/base.vto
---

<article>
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  <div>
    {{ body |> md }}
  </div>
</article>
```

</lume-code>

## Generate pages from other sources

This simple concept of using generators to generate pages is very flexible and
can be used for many use cases. For example, we can generate pages from a
Database or an API:

```js
import database from "./my-database.ts";

export const layout = "layouts/article.vto";

export default function* () {
  const articles = database.query("select * from articles");

  for (const article of articles) {
    yield {
      url: `/articles/${article.slug}/`,
      ...article,
    };
  }
}
```

In this example, we use a database to get all articles and a generator to
generate a new page per article. Each yielded article contains the URL and other
properties you like (title, category, tag, body, etc.). We are exporting the
`layout` value so all pages will use the same layout to render.

Another common use case is pagination. Go to
[Search and paginate](./searching.md) for more info.
