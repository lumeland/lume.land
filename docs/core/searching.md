The variables `search` and `paginate` are global functions that allow searching
other pages and paginating the result.

## Searching pages

The function `search.pages()` returns an array of pages you can filter and sort.
For example, to search pages having the variable `category` equals to `music`,
use the following code:

```vento
<ul>
  {{ for page of search.pages("category=music") }}
  <li>{{ page.title }}</li>
  {{ /for }}
</ul>
```

Each `page` returned is an object with the data assigned to this page (like
variables in the front matter, or in the _data.* files). In the example above,
we use the title of every page to build the list.

The `search` helper is very powerful and has more interesting features.
[Go to the Search plugin documentation](../../plugins/search.md) for more info.

## Pagination

In Lume [you can create multiple pages using a generator](./multiple-pages.md).
Pagination is basically the same thing: creating multiple pages using the result
of a search.

Let's say we want to paginate some pages in groups of 10 elements. We could do
it manually with a generator:

```js
export default function* ({ search }) {
  // Select the pages
  const pages = search.pages("category=music");
  const totalResults = pages.length;

  let currentPage = 1;

  while (pages.length) {
    // Extract the 10 first results
    const results = pages.splice(0, 10);

    yield {
      layout: "layouts/post-list.vto",
      url: `/music/page-${currentPage}/`,
      results,
      pagination: {
        currentPage,
        totalResults,
      },
    };

    // Increase the page number
    ++currentPage;
  }
}
```

In this example we have selected all pages to generate a page for each 10
results with the urls `/music/page-1/`, `/music/page-2/`, `/music/page-3/`, etc.
Every page uses the layout `layouts/post-list.vto` that will receive, among
others, the variables `results` (with the array of results to show in this page)
and `pagination` (with some useful info like the current page number or the
total results).

[The Paginate plugin](../../plugins/paginate.md) (enabled by default in Lume),
exposes the `paginate` helper to ease this process. The previous example can be
done in this simpler way:

```js
export const layout = "layouts/post-list.vto";

export default function* ({ search, paginate }) {
  const musicPages = search.pages("category=music");

  for (const page of paginate(musicPages))) {
    yield page;
  }
}
```

info.
