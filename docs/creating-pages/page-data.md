title: Page data
description: Assign custom data to the pages

Pages can contain arbitrary data. In Markdown files, the data is defined in the
**front matter** block, a block delimited by two triple-dashed lines containing
[YAML](https://yaml.org/) code. There are other formats that can have front
matter or store the data in different ways. Let's see some examples:

<lume-code>

```yaml { title="page.md" }
---
title: This is the title
url: custom-url.html
---

This is the page content
```

```yaml { title="page.yml" }
title: This is the title
url: custom-url.html
content: This is the page content
```

```yaml { title="page.vto" }
---
title: This is the title
url: custom-url.html
---

<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
This is the page content
```

```json { title="page.json" }
{
  "title": "This is the title",
  "url": "custom-url.html",
  "content": "This is the page content"
}
```

```js { title="page.page.js" }
export const title = "This is the title";
export const url = "custom-url.html";

export default () => "<p>This is the page content</p>";
```

</lume-code>

In the examples above, all pages contain two variables: `title` and `url`.

In formats with front matter (like Markdown, Vento and Nunjucks), the content is
defined below the front matter. Formats that don't use front matter export the
content as the `content` variable or, optionally, as a default export (like in
`page.page.js`).

## Standard variables

There are some special variables that **Lume** understands:

### url

The `url` variable contains the public URL of the page, useful to create links
and configure the output filename. If it doesn't exist, it's generated
automatically by lume. See [URL docs](./urls.md)

### date

If it's not defined, Lume automatically uses the file creation date. This
variable can be defined in the filename
[See Page date](./page-files.md#page-date) or in the front matter. The accepted
values are:

- Any `IS0 8601` compatible date, like `2021-01-01`, `2021-01-01 03:10:10`,
  `2021-01-01T03:10:10Z`, `2021-01-01Y03:10:10-0700`, etc.
- The special value `Git Created` to get the first time this file was added to
  the Git history. It uses the creation date as fallback.
- The special value `Git Last Modified` to get the last time this file has
  changed in the Git history. It uses the last modified date as fallback.

### draft

The draft variable marks this page as a draft, which means it will be ignored
unless the environment variable `LUME_DRAFTS` is set to `"true"`.

### layout

Defines the layout that is used to render the page. See [Layouts](layouts.md)
for more info.

### tags

Tags are used to group pages. See [Tags](tags.md)

### templateEngine

To override the template engine used to render the page. See
[Template engine](../core/multiple-template-engines.md)

### renderOrder

To customize the order in which the page is rendered. See
[Render Order](../core/render-order.md)

### mergedKeys

To customize how some data is merged. See
[Merged Keys docs](../core/merged-keys.md)

<lume-code>

```yaml { title="Front matter" }
---
url: /welcome.html
date: 2021-01-01
layout: layouts/post.vto
draft: true
tags: post
---
```

```js { title="JavaScript" }
export const url = "/welcome.html";
export const date = new Date("2021-01-01T03:24:00");
export const layout = "layouts/post.vto";
export const draft = true;
export const tags = ["post"];
```

```js { title="JavaScript (alternative)" }
const data = {
  url: "/welcome.html",
  date: new Date("2021-01-01T03:24:00"),
  layout: "layouts/post.vto",
  draft: true,
  tags: ["post"],
};

export default data;
```
