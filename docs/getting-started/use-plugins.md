In the previous step, we learned how Lume can load assets and process them.
Fortunately, you won't need to do this very often, because many common
operations that you may want to do are already implemented in Lume in the form
of [plugins](/plugins/).

Plugins provide an extremely simple interface to configure Lume to perform
operations like [transpile JavaScript](../../plugins/esbuild.md),
[transform images](../../plugins/transform_images.md),
[generate site maps](../../plugins/sitemap.md), etc. Plugins cover the common
problems and tasks you can have when creating a website.

## Minify CSS with a plugin

To minify your CSS code, instead of configuring Lume to load and process CSS
files, you can use one of the plugins available for this. In this example let's
use [lightningcss](../../plugins/lightningcss.md) a plugin to use
[Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/), an extremely fast CSS bundler and
minifier, that not only minifies the code but also transforms it to make it
compatible with all browsers.

To use a plugin in Lume, you have to import it in the `_config.ts` file and
enable it with the `use()` function:

```js
import lume from "lume/mod.ts";
import lightningCSS from "lume/plugins/lightningcss.ts";

const site = lume();
site.use(lightningCSS());

export default site;
```

That's all! All the logic to configure Lume to load `.css` files and process
them is hidden behind the plugin. Your `_config.ts` file is now much more clean.
